# LAB2 - Lab Work Synthesis â€“ TFTP Client
### MILITON Pierre and YAO Emilie 

## Objectives

The goal of this lab assignment is to develop a TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) client that can transfer files between a client and server using the RFC specifications for TFTP.
The objectives include:
- Building both a file download and upload client for TFTP.
- Implementing features such as blocksize optimization, error handling, and packet loss recovery.
- Testing the client with various file types and sizes while adhering to RFC standards.

## Answers
### Question 1  

The main function verifies if the number of command-line arguments is equal to 3. If not, it displays an error message with the correct usage instructions. It extracts the server host and filename from the command-line arguments and proceeds to call the puttftp and gettftp functions.

***Terminal output***

### Question 2

The main function initializes a *struct addrinfo hints, res, and uses getaddrinfo to retrieve the server's address, and then extracts it.

### Question 3

The program creates a socket. If an error occurs during socket creation, it prints an error message, "Socket creation error," and exits. It also checks for any connection errors with the server, and if the connection fails, it displays an error message.

### 4.a.

*Construction of the RRQ Packet*   
The opcode field of the rrqPacket is assigned the RRQ opcode. The htons is then used to convert the opcode to network byte order (big-endian).

*Transmission of the RRQ Packet to the Server*   
The RRQ packet is transmitted to the TFTP server using a UDP socket. The sendto function is used to send the RRQ packet to the server. The parameters used are as follows:   
- sockfd: The socket file descriptor.   
- &rrqPacket: A pointer to the RRQ packet.   
- sizeof(rrqPacket): The size of the RRQ packet in bytes.   
- 0: Flags set to zero.   
- server_addr: A pointer to the server's address structure.   
- sizeof(struct sockaddr): The size of the server's address structure, in bytes.

The sendto function is called as follows:
sendto(sockfd, &rrqPacket, sizeof(rrqPacket), 0, server_addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr));
